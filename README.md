# Optimization using Python

(1) Markdown Pricing Linear Optimization with Pyomo package

Solve a linear pricing optimization model for 200 products in a given week to determine a pricing plan, and get:
a. The optimized pricing plan (weeks at each price)
b. Revenue projection
c. The current price according to the optimized pricing plan.

(3) Mixed Integer Linear Optimization - DC Location and Transportation Model with Pyomo package

Consider data from a manufacturer who distributes nationwide. They are now deciding where to locate their distribution centers (DCs). There are 23 potential DC locations and 76 cities they need to serve. Each potential DC location has a fixed annual operating cost if they locate a distribution center there. The data also includes the per unit distribution cost from each potential DC location to each region, the capacity of each potential DC location, and the required shipping demand in each region. We need to determine how many and which DC locations to use – and how DCs satisfy the retail city demand needs - in order to minimize the total fixed operating expenses plus distribution costs. Formulate and solve the model as a mixed integer linear program and use Pyomo package to solve it.
